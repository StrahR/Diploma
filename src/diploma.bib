  abstract   = {We develop a new framework of algebraic theories with linear parameters, and use it to analyze the equational reasoning principles of quantum computing and quantum programming languages. We use the framework as follows: we present a new elementary algebraic theory of quantum computation, built from unitary gates and measurement;we provide a completeness theorem or the elementary algebraic theory by relating it with a model from operator algebra; we extract an equational theory for a quantum programming language from the algebraic theory;we compare quantum computation with other local notions of computation by investigating variations on the algebraic theory.},

  abstract  = {We extend universal algebra and its equational logic from first to second order as follows. 1. We consider second-order equational presentations as specified by identities between second-order terms, with both variables and parameterised metavariables over signatures of variable-binding operators. 2. We develop an algebraic model theory for second-order equational presentations, generalising the semantics of (first-order) algebraic theories and of (untyped and simply-typed) lambda calculi. 3. We introduce a deductive system, Second-Order Equational Logic, for reasoning about the equality of second-order terms. Our development is novel in that this equational logic is synthesised from the model theory. Hence it is necessarily sound. 4. Second-Order Equational Logic is shown to be a conservative extension of Birkhoff's (First-Order) Equational Logic. 5. Two completeness results are established: the semantic completeness of equational derivability, and the derivability completeness of (bidirectional) Second-Order Term Rewriting.},
